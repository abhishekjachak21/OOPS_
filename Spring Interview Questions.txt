-> What is auto-configuration in Spring Boot, and how does it work?
- Auto-configuration in Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the libraries present in the classpath. 
- For example:
If spring-web is on the classpath, Spring Boot configures a default DispatcherServlet for web applications.
If spring-data-jpa is on the classpath, it configures a default EntityManagerFactory and DataSource.
Auto-configuration is enabled by the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation, which is part of @SpringBootApplication.
