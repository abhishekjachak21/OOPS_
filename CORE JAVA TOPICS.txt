=================================================================================================================

Abstraction, achieved by abstract class and interfaces
- why abstraction ? Increases security, hides complexity & can focus on what matters
- what is ? only essential details while hiding the rest.
- abstract class can have both abs method, non-abs meth
- while inheriting into other class or interface, must implement abs methods
- interface, has "public static final" fields, "public abstract" methods by default
- after Java8, default and static methods are also allowed
- after java9, private methods are allowed
