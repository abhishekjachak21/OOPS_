11 POD - 4ft, 3bk, 1 scrum master, 1 automation, 1 tester
mainframe, Infosys - finical
monolithic(tightly coupled -> acc, loan, payments), microservice(disad-maintainence increased)
insurance - guidewire mainframe tool
80% -> monolithic, outdated, hard to change
user -> exp API -> process API -> Syst API -> Core Banking system
validations are done in exp api
logic write in process api, changes are done in process but never system api
- 90% possi , syst api in xml/soap, hard to change syst api
- if we don't diff three of them API, then it cud monolithic
- 90% api done in java, .net
- backbase use apache cml
-----> MULE is useful in exp API, process API, but never Syst API

API gateway
- does the work of monotisation
- mule too is api gateway, for control
- api is gateway for security purpose
- it is a layers of authorization
- person come with gun, so he blocked
- monotisation - mulesoft, apigee
- apigee has solid monitsation
- open source dont do monotisation.
- without API gateway, nothing possible.
- KONG - api gateway, less money reqd.

Requirement gathering
---> UI, architect as BK dev, developer - jira

mule integration with KAFKA is v.imp

- consumer has listeners to listen notifications of by producer


=====================================
Got it! Let’s go step by step with **detailed explanations** of each point in an **industrial context**, correcting any misconceptions if necessary. Here’s a deeper dive:

---

### **1. User - UI - API - Mainframe - Database**
   - **Flow Explanation**:
     - **User**: The end-user interacts with the system via a user interface (UI).
     - **UI**: 
       - Built using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular).
       - It sends requests to the backend (API) for data or actions.
     - **API (Backend)**:
       - Acts as the bridge between the UI and the underlying systems.
       - Processes requests, applies business logic, and retrieves or modifies data.
     - **Mainframe**:
       - Large-scale legacy systems used for critical applications (e.g., core banking).
       - Data might be stored in hierarchical or flat-file formats, accessed via COBOL programs or APIs.
     - **Database (DB)**:
       - A structured data store (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
       - APIs interact with databases to fetch or store data.

   - **Real-world example**:
     - In online banking:
       - A user logs in via the UI, which sends the credentials to the backend API.
       - The API validates the user by querying the mainframe for existing customer details and retrieves account balances from the database.

---

### **2. JIRA - Like FB Only**
   - **Detailed Explanation**:
     - **JIRA**:
       - A tool for managing work in software development projects.
       - Tracks issues, tasks, bugs, features, and project progress.
       - Organized using boards (Kanban, Scrum) with columns for stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).

   - **Why "Like FB"?**
     - It’s a central hub where all team members collaborate and update statuses, like sharing posts or updates on Facebook.

   - **Practical Use**:
     - Developers log tasks (e.g., "Build login API").
     - QA testers track bugs (e.g., "Login API returns 500 error").
     - Managers monitor overall progress.

---

### **3. Agile, Waterfall, Story Points, Scrum Master**
   - **Agile**:
     - A **flexible, iterative** approach to software development.
     - Key concepts:
       - **Sprints**: Short, fixed timeframes (e.g., 2 weeks) for delivering incremental functionality.
       - **Daily Stand-ups**: Quick meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and plans.
       - **Retrospectives**: Post-sprint discussions to identify improvements.

   - **Waterfall**:
     - A **linear approach**:
       1. Gather requirements.
       2. Design the solution.
       3. Develop the product.
       4. Test the product.
       5. Deploy.
     - No scope for changes once a phase is completed.

   - **Story Points**:
     - A unit of estimation used to measure the complexity or effort required for a task.
     - Tasks are estimated in points (e.g., 1 = very easy, 8 = very hard).

   - **Scrum Master**:
     - A facilitator in Agile who:
       - Removes roadblocks.
       - Ensures the team adheres to Scrum practices.
       - Coordinates sprints and meetings.

---

### **4. 11 POD Structure**
   - **Detailed Breakdown**:
     - **POD**: A self-sufficient team delivering a complete feature or functionality.
     - Members:
       - **4 Frontend developers**: Build the UI.
       - **3 Backend developers**: Write APIs and business logic.
       - **1 Scrum Master**: Facilitates Agile processes.
       - **1 Automation engineer**: Writes automated tests to ensure reliability.
       - **1 Tester**: Manually tests features for bugs.

---

### **5. Monolithic vs. Microservices**
   - **Monolithic**:
     - Single codebase containing all functionality.
     - Disadvantages:
       - Hard to scale: One change requires redeploying the whole application.
       - Hard to maintain: Tightly coupled components mean one failure could bring down the whole system.

   - **Microservices**:
     - Application split into smaller, independent services.
     - Each service:
       - Runs independently.
       - Communicates with others via APIs (REST, gRPC).
     - Disadvantages:
       - Increased maintenance and operational complexity.
     - Example:
       - Netflix has separate services for login, video streaming, recommendations.

---

### **6. Guidewire Mainframe Tool**
   - **What is Guidewire?**
     - A suite of applications specifically designed for the insurance industry.
     - Used for:
       - Policy management.
       - Claims processing.
       - Billing systems.

   - **Industrial Relevance**:
     - Many insurance companies still rely on Guidewire for its stability and integration with mainframes.

---

### **7. API Layers**
   - **Experience API**:
     - Handles user-facing requests.
     - Performs validation and UI-specific data transformations.
   - **Process API**:
     - Contains the business logic.
     - Handles complex workflows and orchestration.
     - Most changes occur here to adapt to business requirements.
   - **System API**:
     - Interfaces with legacy systems or databases.
     - Often uses XML/SOAP and is rarely changed due to its complexity.

   - **Why Separate APIs?**
     - Keeps the system modular and prevents creating a monolithic structure.

---

### **8. API Gateway**
   - **Purpose**:
     - Acts as a gatekeeper for APIs.
     - Functions:
       - **Security**: Filters and blocks unauthorized requests.
       - **Monetization**: Tracks and bills for API usage.
       - **Rate limiting**: Controls the number of requests to prevent overload.

   - **Popular Tools**:
     - **MuleSoft**: Enterprise-grade API gateway with powerful integration capabilities.
     - **Apigee**: Strong in API monetization.
     - **KONG**: An open-source option, cost-effective for startups.

---

### **9. Requirement Gathering**
   - **Process**:
     - **UI Designer**: Understands user needs and designs interfaces.
     - **Architect**: Creates the technical structure.
     - **Backend Developer**: Implements the architecture.

---

### **10. MuleSoft Integration with Kafka**
   - **Kafka**:
     - A distributed event-streaming platform.
     - **Producer**: Sends events (e.g., a payment initiated).
     - **Consumer**: Listens for events (e.g., a notification system).
   - **MuleSoft's Role**:
     - Integrates Kafka with other systems.
     - Example:
       - MuleSoft consumes messages from Kafka for processing and sends results to downstream systems.

---

### **Corrections or Additions**
- MuleSoft is **not limited to Experience and Process APIs**; it can act as a System API in specific cases.
- Monolithic systems still dominate, but industries are slowly adopting microservices due to their flexibility.

Would you like me to expand on specific technical implementations, tools, or workflows?

Would you like more hands-on examples, or a deep dive into a specific tool like Apigee or MuleSoft?

=============================================================\




To understand the **overall workflow** in an industrial setting involving APIs and tools like MuleSoft, Apigee, and API gateways, let’s consider a step-by-step example that ties together **UI, Experience API, Process API, System API, and backend systems**.

---

### **Scenario: Online Banking Workflow**
A customer uses a banking app to check their account balance and perform a fund transfer.

---

### **1. User Interaction: Frontend (UI Layer)**

- **User Action**:
  - The customer logs into the mobile app, navigates to the "Accounts" section, and requests account details.
  - Later, they choose to transfer money to another account.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **UI**: React Native or Angular for mobile/web interface.
  - **API Call**: Frontend makes HTTPS requests to the **Experience API**.

---

### **2. Experience API**
- **Role**: Tailor data and logic for the specific user interface.
- **Tasks**:
  - Accepts the user's request in a user-friendly format (e.g., JSON).
  - Passes the request to the **Process API** for business logic.
  - Formats the response for the UI layer (e.g., removing unnecessary fields).
- **Example**:
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/accounts/{userId}`
  - Response:  
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "accounts": [
        { "type": "Savings", "balance": 5000 },
        { "type": "Credit Card", "balance": -200 }
      ]
    }
    ```

---

### **3. Process API**
- **Role**: Handle business logic and orchestrate multiple backend calls.
- **Tasks**:
  - Validate user credentials (e.g., check session/token validity).
  - Call multiple **System APIs** to fetch user details, account balances, and transaction history.
  - Combine, transform, or process data into meaningful results.
- **Example**:
  - Logic:
    - Call System API 1: Fetch basic user details.
    - Call System API 2: Fetch all linked accounts and balances.
    - Perform a fraud check by calling a third-party API.
    - Aggregate the data into a single response.
  - Built using:
    - MuleSoft, Spring Boot, or Node.js.

---

### **4. System API**
- **Role**: Directly connect to and interact with the core systems or databases.
- **Tasks**:
  - Fetch raw data from backend systems such as a core banking platform or legacy mainframes.
  - Minimal logic, often just exposing data securely.
- **Example**:
  - **Core Banking System API**:
    - Endpoint: `POST /getAccountDetails`
    - Request:  
      ```xml
      <Request>
        <UserId>12345</UserId>
      </Request>
      ```
    - Response:  
      ```xml
      <Response>
        <Account>
          <Type>Savings</Type>
          <Balance>5000</Balance>
        </Account>
        <Account>
          <Type>CreditCard</Type>

Would you like a hands-on code example for any of these APIs, or additional insights into tooling like Apigee and MuleSoft?

==========================================================================


Alright! Let’s imagine we’re talking about **REST** and **SOAP APIs** using something a second-grader can easily understand. 😊  

---

### **What’s an API?**
Think of an API as a way for two toys to talk to each other. Let’s say you have a **robot toy** that can do things like dance, sing, and tell a joke. You tell the robot what to do by pressing buttons. These buttons are like an **API**—they let you control the robot without needing to know how it works inside.

---

### **REST API: A Simple Mailbox System**
- **What it is**: REST API is like sending and receiving letters using a mailbox.  
- **How it works**:
  1. You write a letter (request) asking for cookies.
  2. You put it in a mailbox addressed to the cookie shop.
  3. The cookie shop reads your letter and sends you a box of cookies (response) in the same mailbox.

- **Why it’s simple**:
  - Each letter (request) and box of cookies (response) is separate and doesn’t depend on the others.
  - The mailbox only needs **addresses (URLs)** and simple instructions like "send cookies" or "show cookie flavors."

- **Example**:
  - You send: "GET cookies."  
  - The shop sends back: "Here are chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry cookies."

---

### **SOAP API: A Fancy Protocol**
- **What it is**: SOAP API is like sending a package through a courier with lots of wrapping, forms, and rules.
- **How it works**:
  1. You want cookies, so you pack your request in a big, shiny box.
  2. You fill out a detailed form (XML) about what you want and why you want it.
  3. The courier service takes your box, delivers it to the cookie shop, and brings back a new shiny box with the cookies.

- **Why it’s fancy**:
  - It’s very detailed and follows strict rules about how the box and form should look.
  - It’s great for big, serious jobs like delivering expensive jewelry or secret codes.

- **Example**:
  - You send: `<Request><Action>GetCookies</Action></Request>`  
  - The shop sends back: `<Response><Cookie>Chocolate</Cookie></Response>`

### **REST vs. SOAP: Comparing Toys**
| **Feature**           | **REST API (Simple Toy)**                                    | **SOAP API (Fancy Toy)**                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**        | Easy, like talking to a friend.                            | Complicated, like writing a formal letter.    |
| **Message Format**     | Simple (uses JSON, like a postcard).                       | Strict (uses XML, like a full package).       |
| **Rules**              | Flexible, like playing on the swings.                     | Strict, like building Lego by the manual.     |
| **Best For**           | Fun stuff like apps or games.                             | Serious stuff like bank transactions.         |

### **Story Example: Asking for Ice Cream**
1. **REST**:  
   - You say: "Can I have chocolate ice cream?"  
   - The shop says: "Sure, here it is!"  
   - Simple, no big deal.

2. **SOAP**:  
   - You say: "I hereby formally request chocolate ice cream in accordance with Section 3.1 of the Ice Cream Rules."  
   - The shop says: "We acknowledge your request and provide you with one chocolate ice cream, packed securely."  
   - Lots of paperwork, but very secure!

---

### **Which One Should You Play With?**
- If you’re just having fun, use REST—it’s quick and easy!  
- If you’re doing something very important and serious, use SOAP—it’s extra careful!  

Was that easy to understand? 😊
